This is the source code package of ConvertLIT 1.8

In this version, most of the outstanding bug reports should be resolved:
  - Cope with buggy generators which write out truncated files 
  - Added dictionary support (disable with -d flag) 
  - Handle duplicated filenames 
  - Completely changed whitespace expansion 
    (Thanks to all the help from people who reported this problem)
  - Fixed very rare LZX Decompression buffer overruns 
  - Should work on MAC OS/X and other big endian hardware
    (If not, send a bug report)
  - Better non-english filename support 

DRM5 support is enhanced in this version

  DRM5 support is now implemented through a "keys.txt" file which should 
  contain the private keys from your activation components.  You create this
  file once with "ReaderKeyRecoveryTool.exe" from the Windows binary package
  and from then on you can use those keys under any environment.

Build changes:

This package now requires "LIBTOMMATH" from math.libtomcrypt.org

To build under Linux:
	cd lib
	make
	cd ../clit16
	make

To build under Windows, Visual C*.
	cd lib
	nmake -f win32.mak
	cd ..\clit16
	nmake -f win32.mak

Now that VC++ 7 is available for "free", supporting MINGW is left as an 
exercise for the interested reader.  Note that getting the free VC++ to the 
point where it can compile ConvertLIT isn't trivial and no support 
will be provided.
